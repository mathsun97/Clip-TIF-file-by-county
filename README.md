# Windbreak project
Project goal is to evaluates the performance of windbreaks in reducing wind-related crop loss for corn and soybean production. We quantified the extent of windbreaks and tree cover on and around agricultural land using high-resolution landcover maps based on imageries from National Agriculture Imagery Program and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS).

1. Clipping large image to country level TIF file (File name: Clip_TIF_byCounty.ipynb)
2. Calculating tree density in/around each farmland using crop cover, trees and forest TIF imagery files (File name: windbreak_tree_density-v9_final.ipynb)
3. Calculating Windspeed around the farmland (To be updated)
